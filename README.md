# Fresh Pokemon Demo Code

This is a demonstration app for Fresh that shows how to use SSR, the islands functionality, APIs and more. You do need to connect it to a [Directus Cloud database](https://directus.cloud/), you can set that up by [following the instructions in the setup project](https://github.com/jherr/build-directus-pokemon-db).

Once that is completed you will have your database and your token and you can use those using the environment variables as shown below.

### Usage

Start the project:

```
DB=[your DB] TOKEN=[your DB token] deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
